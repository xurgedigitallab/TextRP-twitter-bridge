# mautwitdm
A Python/Asyncio Twitter library that can be used for developing Twitter DM clients.

The official account activity API is only suitable for developing things like bots and enterprise
systems. This library acts like the Twitter web app instead, so anyone can run the client with their
own account without having to set up the complicated webhooks required by the account activity API.
